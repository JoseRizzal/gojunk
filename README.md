This repo contains different small handlers, that I wrote to make my life easier in working environment

## portable name generator
Create two-word name, when first name is real (picked from dictionary preset), second one is generated by consonants (c) and vowels (v) as 'cvcvc' (5 characters by default) and separated by '_'

E.g. `cozy_rataz`, `frosty_xehah`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	namegen "github.com/JoseRizzal/gojunk/portable_name_generator"
)

func main() {

	nGen := namegen.CreateNameGenerator()
	fmt.Println(nGen.Generate())

}
```
